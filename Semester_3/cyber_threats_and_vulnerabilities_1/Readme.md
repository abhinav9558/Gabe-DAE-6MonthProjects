#### APT Campaign Mapping*

🎯 1. MintsLoader

A cybercriminal loader-as-a-service group that distributes payloads via compromised websites, typosquatted domains, malicious ads, and phishing-like campaigns.
Notably, they've deployed StealC as part of their malware payloads in PPI (pay‑per‑install) schemes 
misp-galaxy.org


🎯 2. “Tusk” (Russian-speaking cybercriminal cluster)

This group operates a multifaceted info‑stealer campaign using social-engineered phishing sites impersonating brands, game launchers, etc.
Its multi‑stage downloader infrastructure has delivered StealC alongside other stealers like DanaBot 

Initial Access → Phishing (T1566)
Execution and Persistence → Fileless loaders
Credential Access → StealC behavior

Map their techniques using ATT&CK TIDs:
T1566 – Phishing
T1204 – User Execution
T1003 – Credential Access
T1071/T1041 – C2 & Exfiltration

### OpenCTI Setup

#### 💻 OpenCTI Setup on Windows 11 Using WSL2

#### Step 1: Enable WSL2 and Install a Linux Distro

Run this in **PowerShell as Administrator**:

```powershell
wsl --install -d Debian
```

#### Set up the WSL Environment 

` sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y `
` sudo apt install docker.io docker-compose git -y `
` sudo usermod -aG docker $USER `
` newgrp docker `

Clone the OpenCTI Docker repository

` git clone https://github.com/OpenCTI-Platform/docker.git openctidocker `
` cd opencti-docker `
` cp .env.sample .env `

Edit your email and password

` nano .env ` 

Launch OpenCTI

` docker-compose pull `
` docker-compose up -d `
` docker ps `

![Docker Compose Up Pull](docker-compose_pull_up_ps.png) 

This will launch:
- ElasticSearch
- MinIO
- RabbitMQ
- Redis
- PostgreSQL
- OpenCTI
- Worker Processes

Note: There is a known problem with ParrotOS (and some debian based distros like Kali Linux) where AppArmor is not fully configured and causes conflict with docker. 

To bypass this error edit the `docker-compose.yml` file and add the configuration below to each docker service.

security_opt:
  - seccomp: unconfined
  - apparmor: unconfined

  Disable AppArmor

### Connectors

OpenCTI connectors are modular integrations that allow the platform to interact with external data sources, threat intelligence feeds, and enrichment services. They automate the import, export, and processing of threat intelligence, ensuring OpenCTI remains up-to-date and interoperable with other tools.

| Type           | Description                                                                                               |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Import**     | Pulls data into OpenCTI from external threat intelligence feeds, such as MITRE, VirusTotal, or ThreatFox. |
| **Export**     | Pushes data from OpenCTI to external systems or storage (e.g., CSV, STIX, MISP).                          |
| **Enrichment** | Enhances existing data in OpenCTI by querying external sources (e.g., IP reputation or malware metadata). |

### Risk Identification

#### 🛑 Risk #1: CVE-2017-14491 — Remote Code Execution via DNS (CVSS 9.8)

Description: A critical flaw in dnsmasq allows an attacker to craft a malicious DNS request that triggers remote code execution.

Exploitation Impact: Full system compromise or backdoor injection, especially dangerous in DNS-based infrastructure.

Exploit Availability: Public exploit code and automated exploitation tools exist.

| Step                     | Description                                                                        |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Patch Immediately**    | Update `dnsmasq` to the latest version that mitigates this vulnerability.          |
| **Network Segmentation** | Isolate DNS services to prevent lateral movement post-compromise.                  |
| **Firewall Filtering**   | Restrict incoming DNS traffic to trusted IP ranges only.                           |
| **Monitor DNS Logs**     | Look for anomalous queries and repeated patterns to detect potential exploitation. |

#### 🛑 Risk #2: CVE-2020-25682 — Buffer Overflow in DNS Query (CVSS 8.3)

Description: A buffer overflow vulnerability in the way DNS queries are parsed can lead to a crash or arbitrary code execution.

Exploitation Impact: Attackers could cause denial of service or execute arbitrary payloads.

Exploit Availability: Known PoCs available online.

| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Apply Security Patch** | Upgrade affected DNS software (e.g., `dnsmasq`, `bind`) to the patched version.   |
| **Deploy IDS/IPS Rules** | Use Snort/Suricata rules to detect malformed DNS queries.                         |
| **Limit Recursion**      | Disable DNS recursion where not necessary to reduce attack surface.               |
| **Log Review**           | Continuously inspect DNS query logs for suspicious patterns or malformed entries. |


### Risk Monitoring

To effectively track and manage identified risks:
📋 Procedure: Ongoing Risk Tracking

    Create a Risk Register

        Document each CVE, associated system, severity, status (Open/Mitigated), and remediation deadline.

    Schedule Weekly Review

        Evaluate progress on applying patches and re-scan systems to validate fixes.

    Integrate with SIEM

        Correlate alerts and vulnerability data to detect exploitation attempts in real-time.

    Notify Stakeholders

        Ensure IT/security teams receive notifications for unpatched high-severity risks via email or ticketing systems.

    Update OpenCTI

        Use connectors or manual entry to track CVE objects and link them to related incidents or observables.

### Documentation

The decision to prioritize CVE-2017-14491 and CVE-2020-25682 is based on:

    CVSS Criticality: Both scored above 8.0, indicating severe risk.

    Public Exploits: Actively exploited in the wild.

    DNS Scope: Affected systems provide core services and are exposed internally and/or externally.

These vulnerabilities pose significant risk to availability and integrity, justifying immediate action.

## 🛡️ 5. Implement Security Monitoring and Incident Response

- [ ] **Security Monitoring**

Using our SIEM software Wazuh we can set up a detection rule for FTP login success/failure events

``` xml
<group name="ftp,windows,">
  <rule id="100120" level="10">
    <decoded_as>windows</decoded_as>
    <match>530 Login authentication failed</match>
    <description>FTP login failed on Windows (FileZilla)</description>
  </rule>

  <rule id="100121" level="5">
    <decoded_as>windows</decoded_as>
    <match>230 Logged on</match>
    <description>FTP login successful on Windows (FileZilla)</description>
  </rule>
</group>
```
